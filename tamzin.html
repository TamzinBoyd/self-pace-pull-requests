    <h1>Hi Everyone!</h1>
    <h2>My understanding of GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      Git Hub is a cloud based repository for team collaboration and version
      control. You can pull code down to your local repo, make changes then push
      back up. You then have the option to merge this into the main branch.
      Which I'm going to attempt now, wish me luck!
